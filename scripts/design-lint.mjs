 * A glyph standing in for a state mark (FB-210).
 *
 * `⚠` and `●` survived on nine screens after FB-203 turned the desk's marks into squares, so the
 * studio marked state two ways depending on which screen you were on. An emoji is a different
 * typeface at a size nobody chose: it renders differently on every platform, and it does not take the
 * tone colour — a `⚠` beside amber text is whatever amber the vendor picked.
 *
 * `<Mark tone>` is the one mark. This rule is what stops the next screen inheriting the old habit,
 * which is the reason the glyphs came back at all: nothing checked.
 *
 * A line that STARTS as a comment is skipped, including the JSX brace-slash-star form, because a
 * comment explaining why the glyph is not used is prose about the rule rather than a rendered mark.
 * A glyph after code on the same line is still caught.
 *
 * `✓` and `✗` are NOT here. They are read as words by a screen reader in a way `●` is not, and the
 * places that use them are lists of checks rather than a state on a sentence. If they drift into
 * marking state, they earn their own line.
