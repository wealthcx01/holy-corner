/**
 * Email and password sign-in. PORTED AS-IS from fountainbridge `lib/password-login.ts` (FB-092),
 * which HC-003 asks for by name, because every rule below was reasoned through there and auth is
 * the last place to rewrite something that already works.
 *
 * Google stays the primary door (plan D8). This is the second one: a small, env-configured
 * allowlist of accounts that may sign in with a password. It exists because some accounts cannot
 * complete the Google flow at all: a walkthrough account John uses to see what another role sees
 * is the case fountainbridge hit (FB-092), and this hub will have the same need.
 *
 * It is NOT self-serve authentication. There is no signup, no password reset and no user table. An account exists exactly when an
 * admin put `email=hash` into `HC_PASSWORD_LOGINS` on the deployment.
 *
 * Hardening rules, in one place so they are testable:
 *  - Only scrypt hashes live in the env; the app never sees or stores a plaintext password.
 *    Mint entries with `node scripts/mint-password-login.mjs <email>`.
 *  - Verification is constant-time (crypto.timingSafeEqual) and burns the same scrypt work for an
 *    unknown email as for a known one, so response timing does not reveal which emails exist.
 *  - Failures throttle per email: after MAX_FAILS wrong passwords the account is refused for
 *    WINDOW_MS regardless of what is typed. In-memory is enough — this is one long-running
 *    server on Railway (plan D3), and the lockout protects against online guessing, not a
 *    stolen hash.
 *  - A malformed env entry is skipped with a loud warning that names its position, never its
 *    content (the most likely typo is pasting a plaintext password where a hash belongs).
 *
 * What signing in grants: only an identity. ROLE AND SCOPE ARE lib/authz ON EVERY
 * REQUEST, exactly as for Google. Authorization never depends on which door was used, and a
 * password account is not more trusted or less (CLAUDE.md #8).
