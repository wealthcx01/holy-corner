/**
 * An amount that is a FACT on a document, not a figure under assumptions (HC-005).
 *
 * ``Money`` above cannot be constructed without an ``assumption_register_ref``, and that is
 * correct for what it is for: a lever NPV or a remediation cost is only meaningful under stated
 * assumptions, and ADR-0002 exists because the prototype subtracted pounds from score-points.
 *
 * Holy Corner needs the other kind. ``USD 5,000`` on invoice INV-001 is not modelled, not
 * uncertain and not an assumption. It is written on a document somebody signed. Putting it in a
 * field named ``assumption_register_ref`` would say the opposite of what is true, and a field used
 * against its own name is how a wrong number survives review: the next reader believes the name.
 *
 * So the two types are distinguished by WHERE THE NUMBER CAME FROM, which is the thing that
 * actually differs:
 *
 * * ``Money`` cites the assumptions that justify a modelled figure.
 * * ``RecordedAmount`` cites the source it was read from - a contract clause, an invoice, a
 *   partner's cash report, a bank statement line.
 *
 * Both are integer minor units with an explicit currency, and neither can exist without
 * provenance. Neither converts to the other, and this package defines no function that takes one
 * and returns the other: a modelled figure and an observed one are not interchangeable just
 * because both are denominated in pounds.
