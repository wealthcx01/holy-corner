/**
 * When a ticket file disagrees with what actually shipped.
 *
 * PORTED VERBATIM from fountainbridge `lib/ticket-drift.ts` (FB-070, hardened by FB-145), because
 * the rules below were each arrived at by getting them wrong there first. The ticket ids and the
 * history cited throughout are fountainbridge's own; they are kept because they are the evidence
 * for why the check works this way. The logic is prefix-agnostic, so it reads HC- ids unchanged.
 *
 * Do not loosen a rule here without reading the paragraph that explains what it cost to learn it.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The board is the answer to "what is happening in my company". On 2026-07-31, **eight tickets said
 * "In review" or "In progress" for work that was merged and deployed** — including everything shipped
 * that day. A board that says work is still in progress days after it went live is worse than no
 * board, because a founder who catches it once stops believing the rest of it and goes to look
 * somewhere else.
 *
 * Nothing marks a ticket as shipped. The lane flips `Todo` → `In progress` when it claims one, and
 * then nothing ever moves it on: a human merging a pull request does not touch the ticket file, so
 * the last recorded truth is whatever someone last thought to type.
 *
 * The eight were corrected by hand. Correcting them by hand is not a fix — it is the reason to build
 * one, and this is the one that fails loudly in CI rather than waiting to be noticed again.
 *
 * ## Telling a shipping commit from a ticket-filing commit
 *
 * The obvious rule — "a commit whose subject starts with the ticket id" — misses real cases. FB-064's
 * code shipped under `docs: the founder's journey, and the five tickets that deliver it (#67)`,
 * because several tickets landed alongside it. The obvious rule would have called that ticket
 * unshipped, which is the same failure in the other direction.
 *
 * What separates them reliably is **what the commit touched**. A commit that files a ticket changes
 * `docs/tickets/` and nothing else; a commit that ships one changes code, scripts or deploy recipes.
 *
 * ## Why "mentions the id anywhere" is the wrong rule
 *
 * The first version counted any shipping commit whose message contained the id, and it produced
 * confident nonsense: FB-034 was reported shipped on the evidence of *"FB-050: the venture brain"*,
 * which merely referenced it in passing, and FB-039 on the evidence of an FB-044 commit. A check that
 * cites the wrong reason is one a developer learns to skim, and a check people skim is worse than no
 * check at all.
 *
 * ## The one rule, and the two that were tried and thrown away
 *
 * Evidence is: **a commit that changed code, whose SUBJECT names the ticket.**
 * `FB-065: bring the composer inside the studio (#68)`. Someone wrote that id into the title of the
 * thing they were shipping. That is deliberate, and it is the repository's own convention — one
 * ticket, one branch, one pull request (CLAUDE.md #1).
 *
 * Two looser rules were tried against the real history and thrown away:
 *
 *  - **"the message mentions the id anywhere"** reported FB-034 shipped on the evidence of
 *    *"FB-050: the venture brain"*, which merely referenced it in passing. A check that cites the
 *    wrong reason is one a developer learns to skim.
 *  - **"the ticket's own file changed in a commit that also changed code"** looked stronger and was
 *    worse. When one pull request ships one ticket and *files five more* — which is exactly what
 *    `docs: the founder's journey…` did — every newly-filed ticket is created by a code-changing
 *    commit, so all five were reported as already shipped. Filing a ticket is not shipping it, and
 *    no file-based signal can tell the two apart.
 *
 * The cost of the strict rule is honest and small: work that ships under a subject which does not
 * name its ticket is not caught. The alternative was a check that cries wolf, and a gate people
 * switch off protects nothing.

/**
 * Words that mean the work is concluded, matched on the status's FIRST word.

 * First-word matching rather than whole-string equality, because a status carries a qualifier as
 * often as not — "Closed — not a defect", "Done (partly reverted)". Requiring an exact match makes
 * the check demand that a perfectly honest status be flattened into one word, which is the opposite
 * of what it is for. "In review" and "In progress (design)" both start with "in" and stay flagged.

 * different route. So the exemption is deliberately a **visible line in the ticket**, not a hidden
 * comment: a founder reading the ticket sees the same explanation the build does.
 *
 *     **Shipped in part:** the executor is built and tested, but not deployed anywhere yet.
